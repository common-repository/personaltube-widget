PersonalTube provides you with exceptional control over the video content, style, appearance and branding of your widget.

You can personalize the video widget to display the exact kind of videos you want for your blog, using keywords as well as topics. 
Our world leading collection of over 300,000 video topics, organized in an intuitive, browsable hierarchy, is wide enough and deep enough 
to describe almost any concept or subject you select. You can also specify a YouTube user account ID, and we can automatically retrieve all their uploaded videos.

or set up AutoAlert for automatic notification about new videos matching your specifications.

You can precisely control the caption, caption bar, borders, colors and size of the video widget to blend in with your blog theme, and personalize the video playback display with your own branding and backlinks.

To deploy the widget on your blog, use your WordPress account menus to install it and add it to your blog sidebar.
Once the widget is installed and configured for the first time, you can return to the PersonalTube account and make changes using our point-and-click dashboard user interface. Any changes you make will be immediately displayed on your live widget, without writing any code. 

If you set up AutoRefresh, our servers will continuously crawl the Internet, retrieve and rank the 
latest videos precisely matching your requirements, and automatically display them on your widget. 

With AutoAlert, these newly discovered videos will be saved in your dashboard approval queue, and you will be sent an email alert. Only the videos you approve will be displayed on the widget.
